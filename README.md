# Project Whiteboard

A tool to help manage, organize and showcase projects.

## Usage

This application allows you to keep track of some common aspects of a project:
- image resources
- a timeline (roadmap)
- a tasks list (to-do list)
- issues needing to be solved
- an archive of past issues that have been solved

Another major feature is the ability to *publish* your project, generating a zip file that includes your image resources and an html file showcasing all of the above all in one page.

## Installation

Releases can be found [here](https://github.com/clovenski/project-whiteboard/releases). Download the appropriate file, unzip it and the executable to start the app can be found in there.

If you cloned/downloaded this repo, make sure you have Node.js installed, then install the app with `npm install`. The shell script `start.sh` can then be used to effectively start the app.

## Notes

Closing the main window currently does not check if you have any unsaved changes, so be cautious when doing so as you will lose those changes.
